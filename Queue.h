 *
 * Header file defines the data for a queue program
 * that reads a string of characters, pushing each
 * character onto a stack as it is read and simultaneously
 * adding it to a queue. When the end is encountered, the
 * program uses the basic stack and queue operations
 * to determine if the string is a palindrome.
